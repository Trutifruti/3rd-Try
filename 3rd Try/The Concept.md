A rogue like platformer.

A game were the players goal is to reach the top of a tower or something using the tools that he finds along the way all while trying not to die falling.

Using a base movement, the player will collect spells and items as he progresses through the levels. The layout of levels could be similar to slay the spire or balatro, but platforming. 
No need for world maps, the progression to the top will be done by moving from room to room 

The synergy will come from the organic use of the tools you win as you progress. 
The immersive sim nature of mosa lina is what I'm going for but with more player driven builds.
The spells and tools ie the juice of the game, will have to give wide possibilities in how you approach a platforming challenge.

The base capacities of the player will be very limited and wont be improvable
- No jump height improvment
- No double jump
All move that will get you truly far will involve spells that you can cast and combine for sweet ass effeeects.  


Because of the nature of platformer games, randomness in levels will probably not be a thing.
Instead, hand crafted levels could be plagued with random statuses like in DRG.
